# Dissonance Lab

This project studies internal conflict between pretrained beliefs and
synthetically induced false beliefs in language models using SDFT.

Core idea:
- Inject a controlled false belief via synthetic documents
- Create epistemic conflict with pretrained knowledge
- Study internal signals that distinguish conflict from task difficulty
